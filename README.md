# mentorallocationsystem
This is a  graphical system that is meant for mentor allocation in colleges and universities for the final year students.
Every year Final Year students are made to make projects for their completion of the degree and sometimes it is hard to Communicate with the Mentors under which they are working so this Project is meant to solve that issue and ease the way of communication between the two parties.
Students also have an issue of choosing their own mentor with whom they might have worked/studied earlier.
This can help students to request the authority for their desired faculties for mentorship and have 1 to 1 conversation with them.
